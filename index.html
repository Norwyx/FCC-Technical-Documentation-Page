                    <p>
                        JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</li>
                        
                        <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</li>
                    </ul>

                        Variables are containers that store values. You start by declaring a variable with the var (less recommended, dive deeper for the explanation) or the let keyword, followed by the name you give to the variable:
                    </p>

                    <code>
                        let myVariable;
                    </code>

                    <p>
                        After declaring a variable, you can give it a value:
                    </p>

                    <code>
                        myVariable = 'Bob';
                    </code>

                    <p>
                        Also, you can do both these operations on the same line:   
                    </p>

                    <code>
                        let myVariable = 'Bob';   
                    </code>

                    <p>
                        You retrieve the value by calling the variable name:
                    </p>

                    <code>
                        myVariable;
                    </code>

                    <p>
                        After assigning a value to a variable, you can change it later in the code:    
                    </p>

                    <code>
                        let myVariable = 'Bob';
                        myVariable = 'Steve';   
                    </code>
                </div>
            </section>

            <section id="comments" class="main-section">
                <header>
                    Comments

                    <p>
                        Comments are snippets of text that can be added along with code. The browser ignores text marked as comments. You can write comments in JavaScript just as you can in CSS:
                    </p> 
                    
                    <code>
                        /*
                        Everything in between is a comment.
                        */  
                    </code>

                    <p>
                        If your comment contains no line breaks, it's an option to put it behind two slashes like this:   
                    </p>

                    <code>
                        // This is a comment
                    </code>
                </div>
            </section>

                        JavaScript includes operators same as other languages. An operator performs some operation on single or multiple operands (data value) and produces a result. For example, in 1 + 2, the + sign is an operator and 1 is left side operand and 2 is right side operand. The + operator performs the addition of two numeric values and returns a result.
                    </p>  
                    
                    <p>
                        There are a lot more operators to explore, but this is enough for now. See <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators" target="_blank">Expressions and operators</a> for a complete list.

            <section id="conditionals" class="main-section">
                <header>
                    Conditionals
                </header>

                    <p>
                        Conditionals are code structures used to test if an expression returns true or not. A very common form of conditionals is the <code>if ... else</code> statement. For example:
                    </p>

                    <code>
                        let iceCream = 'chocolate';
                        if(iceCream === 'chocolate') {
                        alert('Yay, I love chocolate ice cream!');
                        } else {
                        alert('Awwww, but chocolate is my favorite...');
                        }
                    </code>

                    <p>
                        The expression inside the <code>if( ... )</code> is the test. This uses the identity operator (as described above) to compare the variable <code>iceCream</code> with the string <code>chocolate</code> to see if the two are equal. If this comparison returns <code>true</code>, the first block of code runs. If the comparison is not true, the second block of code—after the <code>else</code> statement—runs instead.
                    </p>
                </div>

                    JavaScript provides functions similar to most of the scripting and programming languages. In JavaScript, a function allows you to define a block of code, give it a name and then execute it as many times as you want. A JavaScript function can be defined using <code>function</code> keyword.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        You can also define your own functions. In the next example, we create a simple function which takes two numbers as arguments and multiplies them:
                    </p>

                    <code>
                        function multiply(num1,num2) {
                            let result = num1 * num2;
                            return result;
                          }
                    </code>
                </div>
